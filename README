20110610.053900 - Bryan Horstmann-Allen on AWS: "AWS gets you 80% there and then starts with the
                  inappropriate touching."
20110609.210700 - Bryan Horstmann-Allen on AWS resiliency: "I have about a month to build an AWS
                  infra that is fault tolerant within a region. I want to shoot myself. My wife
                  is currently ranting about cold failover sites."

20110609.210100 - John E. Vincent on NetApp status messages: "progress bar motherfucker... do you
                  speak it"

20110609.205300 - Joe Miller on lame code repositories: "sourceforge is the detroit of open source
                  software"

20110427.160400 - John E. Vincent on Amazon Web Services: "Dear Jeff Bezos, please don't mention
                  EBS right now. My ass still hurts."

20110421.193600 - Bryan Horstmann-Allen on AWS outages: "Talking smack about those of us on EC2
                  today? You have some pretty short memory about your own provider. Shut your face."

20110421.153400 - Bryan Horstmann-Allen on catching up: "Paying down technical debt while still
                  sprinting is hard."

20110414.175300 - Jason Dixon on RightScale: "RightScale is everything I despise about firewall
                  GUIs. Easy abstraction, minus the easy."

20110413.203200 - Bryan Horstmann-Allen on Google: "I feel pretty strongly about using as few
                  Google services as I can. Not because I think they're any more evil than any
                  other corporation, but just because their shit gets on my dick wrong."

20110412.230500 - Jeramey Crawford on Nagios: "NRPE is pretty stupid, too, but at least it is

                  don't want"

20110411.174100 - Jordan Sissel on node.js: "same reasons ruby annoys me a times, but like 10x
                  worse. It's like they steer the API decisions through /dev/random on every
                  minor release"

20110411.162500 - Jason Dixon on metrics via XML: "if my choice is XML or other, I'll take JSON.
                  then other. then XML."
